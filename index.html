          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> Currently (Sept 2022) I am a postgraduate researcher at ICCUB specialized in deriving bounds from combinations of various probes in order to constrain the current cosmological standard model and extensions thereof, especially in the context of the Hubble and S<sub>8</sub> tension. </p>
          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> This research is primarily structured along four main topics: </p>
          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> - Cosmological tensions </p>
          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> - Models of Dark Matter </p>
          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> - Thermal history </p>
          <p style="font-family: madetommy;"> - Numerical Optimization </p>
          <p  style="font-family: madetommy;"> Of course I am always happy to add more topics to this list. If you have a proposal, don't hesitate to contact me. </p>
          <p> More details for each of these topics can be found below.</p>

            <div class="collapsedpanel"> <p>
               The current tensions between the data sets from various different experiments provide an important starting point for investigating extensions of the current cosmological standard model. This data-guided approach requires both a diligent re-investigation of current measurements and creative model building. Focusing especially on the Hubble tension within the &#039B;CDM cosmological standard model, I have investigated constraints from a combination of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) that provide alternative constraints to H<sub>0</sub> than those from the CMB. In particular we independently confirmed and extended previous work using our own BAO and BBN likelihoods varying the underlying theoretical models and experimental analyses from BBN, as well as investigating the impact of extending the analysis by additional relativistic relics. In my future research I would like to investigate this particular tension both from within the &#039B;CDM model through the combination of various CMB and non-CMB measurements and in extended models. A similarly thorough investigation is required for the S<sub>8</sub> tension, for which I would love to confront weak lensing data with Lyman-α forest measurements and other measures of the matter power spectrum in a model-independent way. In light of the S<sub>8</sub> tension I have also investigated in detail the impact of cannibalistic dark matter on the matter power spectrum and weak lensing observables. For the purpose of this project I closely collaborated with Stefan Heimersheim in implementing the background and perturbation equations of cannibalistic dark matter within a Boltzmann solving code. We found that the model is able to ease the S<sub>8</sub> tension with only a minor impact on the CMB. However, current data does not yet show a significant preference for it.

            <div class="collapsedpanel"> <p> 
Whereas we are confident about certain properties of dark matter (clustering strength, lack of very strong interactions, current abundance), there are other properties which are almost unconstrained. This can be both a great opportunity for creative model building to reconcile disparaging measurements but also a stifling lack of clear direction in the vast model space. As such, my research focuses on models of dark matter which are phenomenologically and theoretically well motivated and at the same time remain falsifiable within the next decades. In my current research I am investigating cannibalistic dark matter (see above), and dark matter interacting with photons, baryons, and/or dark radiation (together with the student Niklas Becker).
In my future research I would like to further qualify the most important phenomenological aspects of different dark matter models that allow them to ease existing tensions and how to constrain these in a model-independent approach. One such approach would be to study the almost universal shape of power spectrum suppression common to many dark matter models.

            <div class="collapsedpanel"> <p> 
The evolution of the thermal state of the universe throughout cosmic history is one of the most important pillars of modern cosmology. Understanding it is crucial for many different probes from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to the Lyman-α forest. In my current research I have tackled the question of how a future detection of Spectral Distortions of the CMB could aid in constraining the ΛCDM cosmological model and exotic energy injections. Within the context of this project I have implemented a consistent treatment of energy injection and the numerical evolution of the thermal bath temperature. Together with my collaborators
I additionally designed a module to calculate the spectral distortions of the CMB based on a Green’s function approach as well as a python likelihood which marginalizes over other astrophysical sources of spectral distortions. In the future I plan to extend this code by a more accurate modeling of reionization, and to interface it with other tools for BBN and recombination physics. As such, the idea is to have a single self-consistent code predict not only CMB and matter power spectra, but to also have an accurate representation of the homogeneous thermal evolution of the universe. This will be especially helpful for an accurate prediction of the signal from the dark ages and the epoch of reionization in view of future experiments. In the future, I would also like to investigate different models that modify the ionization history, especially around the time of photon decoupling or reionization.
In addition to this ambitious goal, I have also worked with collaborators in Saclay to derive novel constraints from the Lyman-α forest to constrain the thermal state of the filaments of the intergalactic medium and to derive bounds on neutrino and thermal warm dark matter masses in a recent analysis of the eBOSS quasar spectra.

            <div class="collapsedpanel"> <p> 
While the previous aspects have focused on specific models and measurements to investigate, this aspect is more focused on how to investigate these. With the advent of increasingly large data sets derived from cosmological experiments and the multitude of probes to be considered, the importance of fast and accurate calculations of cosmological observables of all kinds cannot be understated. Here, my research has branched across several different ingredients. In detail, I have implemented an alternative way of calculating angular power spectra beyond the traditional line-of-sight approach, which allows for a speedup of the computation of these spectra by several orders of magnitude. This means that angular power spectra might present an alternative analysis tool with respect to the regular matter power spectrum in the analysis of spectroscopic galaxy clustering data such as from the upcoming Euclid satellite experiment.
Furthermore, I am collaborating on a project (titled CosmicNet) to use machine learning predictions to replace lengthy calculations of differential equations based on analytical un- derstanding of the functions to be predicted. I am independently investigating methods of speeding up the computation of oscillatory integrals (such as line-of-sight integrals) and oscillatory differential equations (such as the perturbation equations of relativistic species) using a combination of numerical and analytical methods, which will hopefully lead to future publications. Furthermore, In the future I would like to investigate some of the unexplored opportunities to use machine learning in cosmology to speed up calculations of observables and likelihoods to make previously unfeasible analyses feasible. In particular I am collaborating on a project that investigates the impact of Gaussian Process emulation of the likelihood function for fast and accurate prediction of Bayesian contours and intervals without requiring to sample many points within the parameter space such as an MCMC chain would require.
